Restaurant,Summary
十六區和風料理,"Fancy ambient, good sushisashimi. True that the rolls come with plastic and you need to remove before eating them, what might give you the feeling of a cheap place. However the quality is good in my opinion. I recommend. One of my favorite Japanese restaurant."
Shi Tzi Beef Noodles,"The beef noodles were good and had a decent amount of tender meat for 120NT. The store is known for their rolls though, so make sure to try those! Although a little bit dry, they were full of flavor and very tasty. On a Friday around 6:30 there was around a ten minute wait."

中山道妻籠宿日式料理,"First of all, I like the place. Will pick it again if I have other celebratory dinner (was their for a friends graduation).

Lots of food to select.. good for group that want heavy meals and varieties of dessert Excellent for someone who can eat anything. Not much options for vegetarian lovers though. You need to shell out extra bucks for beer."
