"Fancy ambient, good sushi/sashimi. True that the rolls come with plastic and you need to remove before eating them, what might give you the feeling of a cheap place. However the quality is good in my opinion. I recommend.","The beef noodles were good and had a decent amount of tender meat for 120NT. The store is known for their rolls though, so make sure to try those! Although a little bit dry, they were full of flavor and very tasty. Also, they make them at the front of the store, so you get to watch them work on them while you wait for your order!",Nice restaurant. A bit pricey but great food and friendly service.,"I would like to mention menu for Vegetarians.

Like in Subway, they can go for Falafel Sandwich which is very good option for them even they can try veg sandwich.

And also you can try cookies which cost around 50 for 3 pieces.",Pork chops a bit stiff. I ordered the pork chop set. Everything else is okay. They provide English menus. Price is not too exorbitant.,"Very nice, friendly staff, everything is fresh and clean. Delicious food, great selection and inexpensive too. The perfect combination. :)",Nice,"I think that there is very tasty food here. Furthermore, it can offer you very kindly service.","The food taste okay
I like the sauce but the food is talways too oily
the price is pretty expensive too","The place is nice and clean, the condiment set up nicely.
I asked for less noodles in my wrap but it turns out  they already pre-made the food. So there is no point to asked
The lady who serves me were nice

The wrap filling is full of noodles but not enough meat or vegetables
So when i took a bite the noodles overpowering and the sauce doesn’t help the flavor of the wrap","Above average hot pot small shop. Specially cooked meat tasted so good. Very nice candidate to have especially in cool season.
Parking is not bad. Employees are friendly and quick response. Seat is limited, always long time wait in cold days.
Sometimes there will be people smoking inside, not good.",The best services and good value for money. Very kind and helpful staff. Great breakfast.,"Their BBQ duck is popular and need to make reservation first.
Here comes some choices:
Sliced roasted duck with mandarin pancakes.
Stir- fried with vegetables
Duck porridge 🥣
Customers enjoyed this main dishes actually.

The restaurant more like Cantonese cuisine.
There are dim sum such as turnip cake, steamed Vermicelli Roll, dumplings…",Good solid food. Clean tasting with subtle flavors for my Western palette. My favorite was the sour vegetables with beef wraps.,a warm small fusion restaurant providing yum boiled dumplings,"P: lovely restaurant！ dorayaki😋 doraemon loves it 🥰

D: They provide free fish soup, hot red bean soup, and drinks~
The seaweed roll taste nice, as well as the vegetables donburi, my fav place to go ","A tiny bit expensive, but worth it when you go pass them.
Recommend to eat them while they're still hot and steamy!",Nice spacious McDonald's and good customer service. Convenient if you're visiting the hospital with family.,"Tasty and cheap lunch box during the lunch or dinner
I love their roast duck, serve in large portion
the chilli is also very good, highly recommend to give a try if you are around","I have the beef noodle here.
The first time is Taiwanese friend bring me here.
The taste is really nice, serve with a big chunk of beef.
The soup is a bit too salty but overall I still love the taste here
The price is pretty expensive compared to other shops","In addition to organic supermarkets, there are meals available! Healthy Bibimbap with Camellia Oil $70 Different meals are provided every day (depending on the mood of the auntie 😆), there are purple rice and five grain rice, and a lot of green vegetables! Delicious and light-hearted! The small portion is very suitable for girls to eat~ I am afraid of getting fat by eating bento every day~","They raised their prices some time ago, which is a pity as their prices was one good thing about it.

Good soup (albeit spicy) and tender meat for the Beef Noodles. I also love the Chaoshous 紅油抄手麵.","Come here on 2022/07/13 for dinner. They have free flow soup & tea, but it was last minute when I ordered my meal, so I just quickly finish them. I ordered 牛丼. The portion is big and make your stomach full.

Their menu is tasty. The price is ok, but may be a bit high for some student.","Ok chicken cutlet(雞排) biandangs. Well kept place, suitable for dining in.","KFC’s one of chain store. No parking lot neither drive thru. If you drive a car, you can park near parking lot. They have 2 kiosk systems for convenient order. You can order at counter if the counter is not busy. You can have some point if you have a membership. They also have KFC App, you may order App and pick up later. But normally App order will not be placed early. So you better take Motorcycle or Car and order by kiosk or counter.","A fairly typical Mos burger. I sat downstairs which was lightly cramped the food itself was nice enough. I had a burger, fries and sweet tea. It was a tasty and freshly cooked, not particularly large so not good you’re too hungry. Overall the main annoyance is that Mos doesn’t take credit cards (apart from specific ones) or the Easycard.","Amazing cp value, but not very authentic Italian taste. Still like it, because the pizza is tasty and the service is great. I also like the interior design a lot.",Its spicy noodles are quite interesting.  Unique flavor but not killing spicy. Its noodle texture is what I like.  Chewy.  They use thin pork slices as wonton fillings but the pork has not been marinated.  They taste plian.  Unlike others use ground pork which come with rich flavors.   Other than these nothing comes special.  Not bad.  But one visit is good enough for me.  Mostly serving college students nearby.,"Very very nice and decent coffee stop, one of the best coffee in Hsinchu city!","resturant is very big. ordered vegetarian set menu, which came with 1 bread with butter, soup, pasta, 1 drink and a cheesecake. pasta ,soup and cheesecake was delicious, I didn't like dates tea it was too sweet. ambiance and service of resturant is good.","First and also last time come to this store.
1/ The staff’s attitude was bad. They are so noisy, keep talking and laughing out loud.
2/ I ordered beef noodle soup. The noodles is hard as stone. Soup not that good.
Disappointed my weekend dinner.","Sort of ok, but expensive","Affordable teppan & nice taste. You can ask the chef to adjust the flavour, like make it less or more saltier.

Their student meal can make your stomach full. It's consist of 1 main protein (beef, lamb, pork), 1 fish steak, vegetables, and soup. If you want it to be fully fish steak for the protein, it's also available .

When there are 2 chef cooking in one station, their serving speed will be faster.","A good cosy Italian restaurant... Food is tasty. Food presentation is good... Very much friendly staff... But they only recieve cash, didn't recieve credit card. Felt bit expensive.","Pork and scallion steamed buns have a strong pepper flavor, a little spicy pepper, and the meat tastes salty. It is suitable for sugar-free tea. The skin of the buns is very Q, and overall it is delicious👍","Tasty food,  fresh and well prepared","I'm a kimchi lover thats I love their kimchi! It was so right. Right spicy and right sour 💜 and ofcourse I'm Filipino so rice is a must and it is available here with matching like samgyupsal meat and chicken.

This is a must try 👌✌","Super long time to wait even there is no many customer
i wait for my food for 1 hour and other customers who come after me can have their food first. The food taste okay","The pasta is meh, portion is pretty good, but somehow the flavor is too light for my taste. Had added Tabasco and pepper myself. Side dishes are actually better, especially the mushrooms. The environment is cozy and spacious.",Satisfied our cravings!!especially the Butter Naan and Butter Paneer Masala every time… Cooked in gentle level of spices and Naan s are soft comparatively. We generally do not prefer a spicy and Robin ji ALWAYS take care of our taste buds preferences… A neat and clean ambience to relish the meal! Most recommended👍,The pizza is good. No compromise with taste. The environment and service is bellow average. The girl in the counter had no interest to serve to the customer. Was standing in front of the counter and she was looking at her phone. After a few akward minutes I had to broke the silence.  Ordered about 8:45 and was waiting to eat at restaurant. Got the pizza after 10-15 mins or so. It was packed for delivery and was informed the store is suppose to close in 25 minutes!!! It suppose to tell before order right?? All was okay if we got the warm behavior! There was  something big missing!!!!,Recommend spicy seafood risotto and tiramisu. The interior decorations were pretty cute with  many Holland dolls. Need reservation for weekend,Nice food,Really good food. Quality food and service.,"tasty noodle place with variety of soup to choose
nice price and serve in good portion",delicious,Delicious homemade breakfast,"The best beef noodle soup in Hsinchu! Highly recommended the stew beef noodle with the thick noodle, you can even choose to add more noodles. The beef roll was the largest I’ve ever seen in Taiwan and it’s delicious! Overall a must visit restaurant in Hsinchu.",Nice place to chill and enjoy a bowl of dessert. Here you can order several variants of shaved ice. You can also buy some kinds of fresh fruit salad. Price range: NT$70-200.,Love it but you better call to order first,Very local restaurant near to science park served Hakka cuisine. Simple deco with bey nostalgic setting in term of chair and table setting. Food was great especially the free range chicken and Hakka steamed pork belly with preserved vegetable. Very traditional food for Hakka cuisine and a must eat when you do come here. The oyster cooked with basil and tofu is so appetising and gorse well with a bowl of white rice. Enjoy the fried pig intestines so much by dipping into the salt and pepper ! Down with few beers for sure .. the steam prawn with tofu in special prepare sauce is so so good! The fried thick noodle is surprisingly turns out great as lots of wok hei you can smell it from far. Love this place .. worth your stop..,The curry salty plus the chicken salty overall it's super salty... The noodle pretty good

Usually about two weeks at a time 3 or 4 times a year.   The staff is very nice and helpful.   English might be an issue if you have a detailed request or question but patience pays off.   Lots of Japanese and other foreigners stay here but not so many from the US.   It is not a luxury Hotel but is a very comfortable place to stay.  The rooms are nice and some are really large.   Some have washing machines and microwaves.   If that is important to you, be sure to ask for that when you make your reservation.   Internet, bottled water, coffee and tea in your room plus a pretty good breakfast buffet.   There is a small grocery store next door so quick trips to get a snack are not a problem.  Many restaurants within easy walking distance.   Shuttle bus to the Science Park is complementary although I often walk.
